# Datapack Best Practices

- **Debug logging** – Call `ResearchDataManager.logLoadedData()` during development to inspect which entries were loaded.
- **Verify prerequisites and unlocks** – Ensure any referenced IDs exist before release.
- **Versioning** – Assign a clear version to your datapack and increment it when content changes so players can track compatibility.
