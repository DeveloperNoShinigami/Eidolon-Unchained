# Enhanced AI Deity System - Features Guide

## üéØ **Complete Answer to User Questions:**

### **Question 1: Can the AI see player data (inventory, etc.)?**
‚úÖ **YES** - The AI can now access:
- **Inventory**: Notable magical items, enchanted equipment, valuable materials
- **Health & Status**: Current health, experience level, effects
- **Location Context**: Biome, coordinates, time of day, weather
- **Ritual History**: Recent chants/rituals performed and their success rates
- **Favor Points**: Separate reputation system for task completion
- **Active Tasks**: Current divine assignments and progress

### **Question 2: Can it remember rituals and give favor?**
‚úÖ **YES** - Comprehensive tracking system:
- **Ritual Memory**: Last 20 rituals/chants with timestamps and success status
- **Favor Points**: Earned through successful rituals (separate from reputation)
- **Persistent Storage**: All data saved to player NBT, survives server restarts
- **Contextual Responses**: AI considers ritual history when responding

### **Question 3: Task system with rewards?**
‚úÖ **YES** - Full task management:
- **Task Assignment**: AI can give players specific divine tasks
- **Requirement Checking**: Validates completion (items, actions, etc.)
- **Favor Rewards**: Completion grants favor points + configured rewards
- **Cooldown System**: Prevents task spam with configurable timers

## üîß **API Error Fix:**

### **What the error meant:**
```
"finishReason": "MAX_TOKENS"
```
- AI response was truncated due to hitting token limits
- No actual text content was returned, just metadata
- Caused by overly long context or high token settings

### **Solutions implemented:**
1. **Token Limit Management**: Reduced max tokens from 1000 to 800
2. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Detects `MAX_TOKENS` and `SAFETY` finish reasons
3. **Context Optimization**: Truncates inventory lists and ritual history
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback messages when AI fails

## üéÆ **Usage Examples:**

### **For Players:**
```bash
# Check your divine favor
/eidolon task favor nature_deity

# List active tasks  
/eidolon task list

# Complete a task
/eidolon task complete plant_seeds

# Check all favor points
/eidolon task favor
```

### **For AI Deities:**
When players pray, the AI can now:
- See their inventory: "I notice you carry ancient runes..."
- Reference past rituals: "Your recent communion with shadow energies concerns me..."
- Assign tasks: "Prove your devotion by gathering sacred herbs."
- Award favor: Player gains favor points for successful rituals
