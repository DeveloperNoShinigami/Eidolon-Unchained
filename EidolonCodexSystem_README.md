Eidolon Unchained Codex System: Class Overview, Issues, and Fixes
Main Classes Involved
1. CodexDataManager
Role: Loads codex categories, chapters, and entries from JSON files in your datapack/resource folders. Handles registration and lookup.
Key Methods: loadCategory, loadChapter, loadEntry, init, logLoadedData, getAllChapterExtensions.
Major Issues:
Registry keys were mismatched (sometimes ResourceLocation, sometimes String).
Constructor signatures for CodexCategory, CodexChapter, and CodexEntry were incorrect.
Static methods required for integration were missing.
Loader logic sometimes failed to add loaded objects to the correct parent (e.g., chapters to categories).
Event registration or loader not being called at the right time.
2. CodexCategory
Role: Represents a codex category (e.g., "Soul Studies").
Fields: key, icon, color, chapters (list).
Major Issues: None in the class itself, but incorrect usage in loader (wrong constructor, wrong key type).
3. CodexChapter
Role: Represents a chapter within a category.
Fields: key, entries (list).
Major Issues: None in the class itself, but loader sometimes used wrong constructor or key type.
4. CodexEntry
Role: Represents an entry (page) in a chapter.
Fields: Varies, but typically includes key, pages, and metadata.
Major Issues: Loader sometimes used wrong constructor or failed to use CodexEntry.fromDatapack.
Major Issues Encountered
Registry Key Type Mismatch

Loader and registry code sometimes used ResourceLocation, sometimes String.
Fix: Standardize on String for all keys, or use ResourceLocation everywhere.
Constructor/Method Signature Mismatches

Loader called constructors with wrong arguments (e.g., missing ItemStack or int color).
Fix: Update loader to match the actual constructor signatures in your codex classes.
Static Method Stubs Missing

Integration required static methods like init(), logLoadedData(), getAllChapterExtensions() in CodexDataManager.
Fix: Add these static stubs, even if they are empty, to avoid integration errors.
Loader Logic Not Adding to Parent

Loaded chapters/entries were not being added to their parent category/chapter.
Fix: After loading, always call the parentâ€™s addChapter or addEntry method.
Event Registration/Loader Not Called

Loader was not being called at the right time, so data was not loaded.
Fix: Ensure loader is registered to the correct Forge event (e.g., data reload or mod init).
Progress Loss

When loader logic or registry keys changed, user progress was lost.
Fix: If possible, provide migration logic or keep registry keys stable.
JSON Data Issues

Sometimes, JSON files were missing required fields or had typos.
Fix: Validate all JSON files for required fields and correct structure.
Possible Fixes
Standardize Key Types: Use String or ResourceLocation consistently for all registry keys.
Match Constructors: Update loader code to use the correct constructor signatures for all codex classes.
Add Static Stubs: Add empty static methods required for integration, even if not used.
Parent Linking: Always add loaded chapters to categories and entries to chapters.
Event Registration: Register loader to the correct Forge event so it runs at the right time.
Validate JSON: Use a JSON schema or manual checks to ensure all required fields are present.
Preserve Progress: Avoid changing registry keys unless necessary; if you must, provide migration logic.
Testing Suggestions
After making changes, always test with a clean world and with an existing world to check for progress loss.
Add debug output in loader methods to confirm data is being loaded and registered.
Validate JSON files with an external tool.
