# Ritual-Based Patron Selection Implementation Summary

## ✅ What We've Built

### 1. Complete Patron Allegiance System
- **AIDeityConfig Enhancement**: Added `PatronConfig` class with opposition/alliance rules
- **Patron Relationship Detection**: `determinePatronRelationship()` method evaluates player status
- **AI Response Filtering**: `canRespondToPlayer()` enforces follower-only restrictions
- **Dynamic Personality**: `buildDynamicPersonalityWithPatron()` adjusts behavior based on allegiance

### 2. Enhanced Chat & Prayer Systems
- **DeityChat Filtering**: Only responds to appropriate followers based on JSON rules
- **Patron-Aware Greetings**: Custom messages based on player's patron status and title
- **Prayer System Integration**: Patron filtering for prayer responses
- **Rejection Messages**: Specific feedback for enemies, neutrals, and godless players

### 3. Ritual-Based Patron Selection
- **RitualPatronHandler**: Event system that detects patron selection rituals
- **JSON-Driven Configuration**: Complete ritual setup in AI deity config files
- **Requirement Validation**: Reputation, cooldown, and conflict checking
- **Command Execution**: Success/failure commands with effects and feedback

### 4. Debug & Testing Infrastructure
- **Manual Event Firing**: `/eidolon-unchained debug fire-ritual-completion <ritual_id>`
- **Patron Status Commands**: Status checking and patron management
- **Configuration Validation**: JSON structure verification and error reporting

## 🧪 How to Test

### 1. Basic Patron Selection (Command-Based)
```bash
# Set up reputation first
/eidolon reputation add <player> eidolonunchained:nature_deity 50

# Choose patron via command
/eidolon-unchained patron choose eidolonunchained:nature_deity

# Check status
/eidolon-unchained patron status
```

### 2. AI Allegiance Filtering
```bash
# Start conversation - should work for followers
/eidolon-unchained chat start eidolonunchained:nature_deity "Hello, my goddess"

# Try with different patron - should be rejected based on config
/eidolon-unchained patron choose eidolonunchained:shadow_deity
/eidolon-unchained chat start eidolonunchained:nature_deity "Hello"
```

### 3. Ritual-Based Patron Selection
```bash
# Test ritual completion event manually
/eidolon-unchained debug fire-ritual-completion eidolonunchained:nature_patronage

# Or perform actual ritual:
# 1. Place Brazier
# 2. Add pedestals with: oak_sapling, wheat_seeds, bone_meal, arcane_gold_ingot
# 3. Add Codex to focus
# 4. Place soul_shard in brazier and activate
```

### 4. Prayer System Testing
```bash
# Test patron-aware prayers
/eidolon-unchained prayer blessing eidolonunchained:nature_deity

# Test with wrong patron
/eidolon-unchained patron choose eidolonunchained:shadow_deity
/eidolon-unchained prayer blessing eidolonunchained:nature_deity
```
