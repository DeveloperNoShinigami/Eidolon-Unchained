## üß† How It Works

### Architecture Overview
```
Player ‚Üí Chant Sequence ‚Üí Effigy Interaction ‚Üí AI Provider ‚Üí Contextual Response
```

1. **Player performs chant** near an effigy to "tune" it to a specific deity
2. **Right-click effigy** to start conversation with that deity  
3. **AI analyzes context**: health, inventory, reputation, location, time, weather
4. **AI generates response** based on deity personality and player relationship
5. **Response displayed** via configurable display system (title/chat)
