# Future Roadmap - Planned Features & Improvements

This roadmap outlines **confirmed planned features**, **community requests**, and **technical improvements** for Eidolon Unchained based on the current stable foundation.

---

## 🎯 Development Philosophy

### Core Principles
- **JSON-First**: All new features configurable via datapacks
- **Backward Compatible**: Never break existing configurations
- **Community Driven**: Features requested and tested by users
- **Quality Over Quantity**: Polish existing features before adding new ones

### Version Strategy
- **Major Releases**: Significant new systems (e.g., v4.0.0)
- **Minor Releases**: New features and improvements (e.g., v3.10.0)
- **Patch Releases**: Bug fixes and optimizations (e.g., v3.9.1)

## 🚀 Short-Term Goals (Next 2-3 Releases)

### 1. **Enhanced Voice & Audio Integration**

      "speechRate": 1.0,
      "ambientSounds": ["wind", "whispers", "chimes"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Benefits:
