## AI Deity Issue Fixes - COMPLETE

### Issues Fixed:

1. **Missing Player Context**: The AI was not using detailed player information (inventory, health, recent activities, etc.) when generating responses.
   - **Fixed**: Updated `DeityChat.buildConversationPrompt()` to call `GeminiAPIClient.buildPlayerContext()` which includes:
     - Player location and biome
     - Time of day and weather
     - Health and experience level
     - Notable items in inventory (magical/valuable items)
     - Recent ritual/chant history

2. **Missing Chant Tracking**: DatapackChantSpell was not recording chant activity for AI context.
   - **Fixed**: Added `PlayerContextTracker.recordChant()` calls to DatapackChantSpell
   - **Result**: AI now knows what chants the player has recently performed

3. **API 400 Bad Request Error**: The API was failing due to missing or invalid API key.
   - **Fixed**: Added proper API key validation and better error messages
   - **Added**: Debug logging to show request details (with masked API key)
   - **Added**: Clear error messages to players when API key is missing

4. **Token Limit Issues**: AI responses were potentially exceeding token limits.
   - **Fixed**: Reduced `max_output_tokens` from 700-800 to 400 in all AI configurations
   - **Fixed**: API client now caps tokens at 300 to prevent overflow
   - **Fixed**: Reduced response word limits in prompts (100 words → 80 words)

### Setting Up API Key:

The AI deity system requires a Google Gemini API key. Set it using one of these methods:

#### Method 1: Environment Variable (Recommended)
```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

#### Method 2: Configuration File
Create file: `config/eidolonunchained/api-keys.properties`
```
gemini.api_key=your_api_key_here
```

#### Method 3: In-Game Command (if implemented)
```
/eidolon-config set-api-key gemini your_api_key_here
```

### How to Get a Gemini API Key:

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Create API key"
4. Copy the generated key
5. Set it using one of the methods above

### Expected Behavior After Fix:

1. **With API Key**: 
   - AI will respond with personalized messages based on player's current situation
   - Responses will mention player's inventory, location, recent activities
   - Each deity will have distinct personality based on their configuration

2. **Without API Key**:
   - Clear error message: "The divine connection requires an API key. Please contact server administrator."
   - Helpful hint about setting GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable

3. **Player Context Integration**:
   - AI knows if player is in a specific biome (plains, nether, etc.)
   - AI knows the time of day and weather
   - AI knows player's health status
   - AI knows what magical/valuable items player has
   - AI knows recent chants/rituals performed

### Testing the Fix:

1. Without API key: Try the Shadow Communion chant - should show clear error message
2. With API key: AI should respond with context-aware messages mentioning player's situation
3. Different players: AI should give different responses based on each player's context
4. Different times/locations: AI responses should vary based on environment

### Technical Details:

- **PlayerContextTracker**: ✅ Now fully integrated, records chants when performed via DatapackChantSpell
- **GeminiAPIClient.buildPlayerContext()**: ✅ Integrated into conversation prompts
- **Token Management**: ✅ Proper limits to prevent API errors
- **Error Handling**: ✅ Clear messages for different failure scenarios
- **Chant Tracking**: ✅ All chant activity is now recorded for AI context

### Summary:

**The AI deity system now has full access to player context including:**
- ✅ Recent chants performed (what, when, which deity)
- ✅ Player inventory (magical/valuable items)
- ✅ Current location, biome, time, weather
- ✅ Health status and experience level
- ✅ Reputation with the deity

**API error handling is now robust:**
- ✅ Clear error messages when API key is missing
- ✅ Token limits prevent overflow issues
- ✅ Debug logging for troubleshooting

**Each deity will now give unique, personalized responses based on the player's complete situation and history.**
