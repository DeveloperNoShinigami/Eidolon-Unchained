# Altar/Effigy Chat Integration System Documentation

## Overview

The Altar/Effigy Chat Integration System provides **natural chat-based conversations** between players and AI deities through Eidolon's existing shrine/altar mechanics. Players type their own messages to have real conversations with deities, and commands are **suggested, not automatically executed**.

## üìÅ Core Components

### 1. Enhanced Prayer System (`PrayerSystem.java`)

**Location:** `src/main/java/com/bluelotuscoding/eidolonunchained/prayer/PrayerSystem.java`

#### Key Changes:
- **`handleEffigyInteraction()`** now starts conversations instead of auto-generating prayers
- Removed automatic prayer generation and command execution
- Now delegates to `DeityChat.startConversation()`

### 2. Deity Chat System (`DeityChat.java`)

**Location:** `core/src/main/java/com/bluelotuscoding/eidolonunchained/chat/DeityChat.java`

#### Key Features:
- **Chat Event Interception** - Captures player messages when in conversation
- **Natural Conversations** - Players type their own messages
- **Command Suggestions** - AI suggests commands, players choose to accept/decline
- **Conversation State** - Tracks active conversations per player
- **Interactive Buttons** - Clickable [Accept]/[Decline] buttons for commands

#### Core Methods:

- **`startConversation(ServerPlayer player, ResourceLocation deityId)`**
  - Initiates conversation with reputation and cooldown checks
  - Sends AI-generated greeting
  - Sets up conversation state

- **`onPlayerChat(ServerChatEvent event)`**
  - Intercepts chat when player is in conversation
  - Processes player messages and generates AI responses
  - Handles conversation commands (goodbye, accept, decline)

- **`suggestCommands()`**
  - Displays command suggestions with interactive buttons
  - Stores pending commands for player approval
  - Provides clear accept/decline options

### 3. Command System (`DeityCommands.java`)

**Location:** `core/src/main/java/com/bluelotuscoding/eidolonunchained/commands/DeityCommands.java`

#### Registered Commands:
- `/deity_accept_commands` - Accept suggested deity commands
- `/deity_decline_commands` - Decline suggested deity commands

### 4. Enhanced AI Configuration

**Location:** `src/main/resources/data/eidolonunchained/ai_deities/nature_deity_ai.json`

#### Auto-Judgment Configuration:
```json
"conversation": {
  "base_prompt": "Player {player} approaches your sacred altar...",
  "max_commands": 2,
  "cooldown_minutes": 10,
  "reputation_required": 0,
  "allowed_commands": ["give", "effect", "playsound", "weather"],
  "auto_judge_commands": true,
  "judgment_config": {
    "blessing_threshold": 25,
    "curse_threshold": -25,
    "blessing_commands": ["effect give @s regeneration 30 1", "give @s minecraft:golden_apple 1"],
    "curse_commands": ["effect give @s slowness 60 1", "effect give @s weakness 30 0"],
    "neutral_commands": ["playsound minecraft:block.bell.use neutral @s"]
  }
}
```

### 2. Effigy Interaction Handler (`EffigyInteractionHandler.java`)

**Location:** `src/main/java/com/bluelotuscoding/eidolonunchained/events/EffigyInteractionHandler.java`

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Currently disabled pending Eidolon dependency setup

#### Features:
- **Event Interception** - Captures `PlayerInteractEvent.RightClickBlock` events
- **Smart Deity Detection** - Maps effigy blocks to specific AI deities
- **Seamless Integration** - Falls back to Eidolon's default system for non-AI deities
- **Proper Cooldown Handling** - Triggers Eidolon's `effigy.pray()` method

#### Event Flow:
1. Player right-clicks effigy block
2. Handler checks if block is an effigy
3. Determines associated deity (if any)
4. Checks effigy readiness (Eidolon cooldown)
5. Delegates to AI system or falls back to Eidolon

### 3. Enhanced AI Configuration

**Location:** `src/main/resources/data/eidolonunchained/ai_deities/nature_deity_ai.json`

#### New Prayer Type: "general"
```json
"general": {
  "base_prompt": "Player {player} approaches your sacred effigy seeking communion...",
  "max_commands": 1,
  "cooldown_minutes": 15,
  "reputation_required": 0,
  "allowed_commands": ["give", "effect", "playsound"]
}
```

#### Benefits:
- **Low Barrier to Entry** - 0 reputation requirement for basic deity contact
- **Contextual Responses** - AI receives detailed player situation data
- **Balanced Interaction** - 15-minute cooldown prevents spam

## üéÆ Player Experience

### Example Conversation Flow:

1. **Interaction**: Player right-clicks nature deity effigy
2. **Greeting**: Verdania: *"Greetings, young seeker. I sense you wish to commune with nature's wisdom. What brings you to my sacred grove?"*
3. **Player Types**: *"I'm lost and don't know which path to take"*
4. **AI Response**: Verdania: *"The forest speaks of many paths, child. Trust in your instincts as animals trust theirs. Would you like my guidance to light your way?"*
5. **Command Suggestion**: 
   ```
   Verdania offers divine assistance:
   ‚Ä¢ /effect give @s night_vision 300 0
   
   Would you like to accept this assistance? [Accept] [Decline]
   ```
6. **Player Choice**: Player clicks [Accept] or types "yes"

- **Low Reputation (‚â§-25)**: Automatic curses (slowness, weakness, ominous sounds)
- **Medium Reputation**: Neutral responses (ambient sounds, minor effects)

### Player-to-Deity Communication:
1. Player types message in chat (e.g., "I seek your guidance")
2. System displays: `You: I seek your guidance`
3. System shows: `Verdania considers your words...`
4. AI generates contextual response
5. System displays: `[Verdania] Young seeker, the forest whispers of your potential.`

### Command Execution Process:

#### Manual Mode:
1. AI suggests appropriate commands based on conversation
2. Commands displayed with clear descriptions
3. Interactive [Accept]/[Decline] buttons
4. Commands execute only after explicit player consent

#### Auto-Judgment Mode:
1. Deity evaluates player's reputation and context
2. Automatically selects appropriate command category

4. Example: `Verdania grants divine intervention...` ‚Üí Regeneration effect applied

## üß† Smart Contextual Features

### Player Agency System:

- **üó®Ô∏è Natural Communication** - Players type their own messages for authentic interaction
- **ü§î Player Choice** - Commands are suggested, never forced
- **üí¨ Conversational Flow** - Back-and-forth dialogue instead of one-shot interactions
- **‚è∞ Flexible Timing** - Conversations can be short or extended based on player interest
- **üéØ Contextual Responses** - AI considers player message content and game context

### Enhanced AI Understanding:

The conversation system includes contextual awareness:
```java
private static String buildConversationPrompt(ServerPlayer player, DatapackDeity deity, 
                                              AIDeityConfig aiConfig, String playerMessage) {
    StringBuilder prompt = new StringBuilder();
    prompt.append("Player ").append(player.getName().getString())
          .append(" says to you: \"").append(playerMessage).append("\"");
    
    // Add game context
    String context = GeminiAPIClient.buildPlayerContext(player);
    prompt.append("\n\nPlayer situation: ").append(context);
    
    // Add conversation guidelines
    prompt.append("\n\nRespond naturally as ").append(deity.getDisplayName())
          .append(". Only suggest commands if specifically asked for help.");
    
    return prompt.toString();
}
```

### Context Categories:

- üí¨ **Message-aware responses** - AI responds to actual player input
- ‚ù§Ô∏è **Health-responsive** - Mentions player condition when relevant
- üçñ **Hunger-aware** - Notices player needs contextually  
- ‚öîÔ∏è **Danger detection** - Responds to threats when mentioned
- üéØ **Deity-specific** - Each deity maintains unique personality and capabilities
- üìç **Location-aware** - References player's current biome and position

## üîß Configuration

### Adding New Effigy Interactions:

1. **Define Prayer Type** in AI deity configuration:
```json
"prayer_configs": {
  "general": {
    "base_prompt": "Custom prompt with {player} context...",
    "max_commands": 1,
    "cooldown_minutes": 15,
    "reputation_required": 0,
    "allowed_commands": ["give", "effect", "playsound"]
  }
}
```

2. **Map Deity to Effigy** in `EffigyInteractionHandler.getEffigyDeity()`:
```java
private static ResourceLocation getEffigyDeity(EffigyTileEntity effigy, BlockPos pos) {
    // Add your deity mapping logic here
    return new ResourceLocation("modid", "deity_id");
}
```

### Customizing Context Generation:

Extend `generateContextualPrayer()` with additional checks:
- Player inventory items
- Nearby blocks or structures
- Biome-specific conditions
- Player achievements or progression
- Current weather conditions

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Notes

### Build Integration:

To activate the full system:

1. **Add Eidolon Dependency** to `build.gradle`:
```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation fg.deobf("elucent.eidolon:eidolon:VERSION")
}
```

2. **Uncomment Event Handler** in `EffigyInteractionHandler.java`
3. **Test Integration** with actual Eidolon effigy blocks

### Debugging:

- Enable debug logging in `EffigyInteractionHandler` for interaction tracking
- Monitor cooldown behavior for proper integration
- Test fallback to Eidolon's default system
