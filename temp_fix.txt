The DeityChat.java file has become corrupted with leftover code. I need to fix the compilation errors by removing the broken leftover methods and code blocks that are causing syntax errors.

The main issues seem to be:
1. Leftover code from old getTierReputationThreshold method
2. Broken method structures
3. Code outside of proper method/class structure

Let me create a clean version of just the fixed method.
